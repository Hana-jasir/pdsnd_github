In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems like:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
#2 Popular stations and trip
#3 Trip duration
#4 User info

for three major cities in the United States like:
2- Chicago. 
2- New York City.
3- Washington.

Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks using Anaconda like:
1- pandas: for DataFrame
2- time: to calculate each analysis process time

The Datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
1- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
1- Gender
2- Birth Year

How to run the project:
